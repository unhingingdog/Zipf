export default = "War and Peace is perhaps best known as one of the longest
novels ever written and its title is often used idiomatically to represent
any allegedly excessively long piece of writing. Tolstoy began writing War and
Peace in 1862, the year that he finally married and settled down at his
country estate. The first half of the book was written under the name '1805'.
During the writing of the second half, he read widely and acknowledged
Schopenhauer as one of his main inspirations. However, Tolstoy developed his own
 views of history and the role of the individual within it. The first draft of
 the novel was completed in 1863. In 1865, the periodical Russkiy Vestnik
 (The Russian Messenger) published the first part of this draft under the
 title 1805 and published more the following year. Tolstoy was dissatisfied
 with this version, although he allowed several parts of it to be published
 with a different ending in 1867. He heavily rewrote the entire novel between
 1866 and 1869. Tolstoy's wife, Sophia Tolstaya, copied as many as seven
 separate complete manuscripts before Tolstoy considered it again ready for
 publication. The version that was published in Russkiy Vestnik had a very
 different ending from the version eventually published under the title War and
 Peace in 1869. Russians who had read the serialized version were anxious to
 buy the complete novel, and it sold out almost immediately. The novel was
 translated almost immediately after publication into many other languages.
 It is unknown why Tolstoy changed the name to War and Peace. He may have
 borrowed the title from the 1861 work of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon:
 La Guerre et la Paix ('The War and the Peace' in French). The title may also
 be another reference to Titus, described as being a master of 'war and peace'
 in The Twelve Caesars, written by Suetonius in 119 CE. The completed novel was
 then called Voyna i mir (Война и мир in new-style orthography; in English
   War and Peace). The 1805 manuscript was re-edited and annotated in Russia
   in 1983 and since has been translated into English, German, French, Spanish,
   Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Albanian, Korean, and Czech. Tolstoy was
   instrumental in bringing a new kind of consciousness to the novel. His
   narrative structure is noted for its 'god-like' ability to hover over and
   within events, but also in the way it swiftly and seamlessly portrayed a
   particular character's point of view. His use of visual detail is often
   cinematic in scope, using the literary equivalents of panning, wide shots
   and close-ups. These devices, while not exclusive to Tolstoy, are part of
   the new style of the novel that arose in the mid-19th century and of which
   Tolstoy proved himself a master. The standard Russian text of War and Peace
   is divided into four books (comprising fifteen parts) and an epilogue in
   two parts. Roughly the first half is concerned strictly with the fictional
   characters, whereas the latter parts, as well as the second part of the
   epilogue, increasingly consist of essays about the nature of war, power,
   history, and historiography. Tolstoy interspersed these essays into the
   story in a way that defies previous fictional convention. Certain abridged
   versions remove these essays entirely, while others, published even during
   Tolstoy's life, simply moved these essays into an appendix."
